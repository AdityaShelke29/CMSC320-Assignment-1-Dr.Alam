Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: One might consider using git for a variety of different reasons. 
First of all, git is the premier tool for tracking changes in codebases. Companies and 
individuals use git so that, if they need to, they can see what changes were done in 
the past in order to solve bugs or get insights for problems they are facing for the 
second time. Next, git is very useful for collaboration. It allows multiple individuals 
to work on the codebase at once while minimizing conflicts where more than one person 
have made conflicting changes to the same file. It provides, also, the ability to 
merge changes from multiple individuals. Finally, git allows people to branch off from 
the main codebase. This allows them to work on a new feature that may otherwise cause 
the main codebase to stop functioning correctly, while still letting the bug - free 
version of the codebase be the master branch.
